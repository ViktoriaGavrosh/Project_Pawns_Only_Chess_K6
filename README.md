# Project_Pawns_Only_Chess_K6
This project created during the learning process

  This program is game Pawns-only chess.
  This game is for two players. The white pawns 
are denoted with the capital W, the black 
pawns are the capital B characters.

  A unique pair of coordinates (a letter and 
a number) identifies each square of the 
chessboard. From White's left to right, 
the squares in the vertical lines are called 
files. They are labeled from a to h. 
The horizontal lines, known as ranks, are 
numbered from 1 to 8. 

  The Pawns-only chess has very simple rules. 
The pawns can make any standard pawn moves 
(e2e4, f5f6), except promotion. A player wins 
the game when one of the pawns reaches 
the opponent's last row, or if all opponent 
pawns are captured. A draw occurs when one 
of the players is unable to make a valid move.
The game can be stopped if one of the players 
enters "exit" .
